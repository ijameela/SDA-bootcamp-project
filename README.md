![stage1-10](https://weclouddata.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/cloud/project-stages/week7-stage10.png)

> **Goal of This Stage**

Based on Stage 7, we are replacing the Azure Function App with Azure Container Apps. The Azure Container Apps will host the backend of the application. The Azure Container Registry will be used to store the backend image. At this stage, we should create and setup infrastructure in this diagram manually.

The GitHub Actions workflow should be updated to deploy the backend to the Azure Container Apps.
